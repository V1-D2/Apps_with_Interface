# Apps_with_Interface
Here I present two apps. One of them I use as my alarm clock and second one was the university programming club project.
new_products.py program creates the interface of the shop. There are 2 accounts: user and admin. User does not require the password when the admin`s is "login". User can add or delete some amount of aviable products to the basket. Moreover, the amount of remaining food depends on how many the user bought. Admin can add/delete/change the amount of the products in the shop.
